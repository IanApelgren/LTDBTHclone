Ian Apelgren & James Cooke

Project Type: Java swing application, incorporating linux/windows scripts, and external security applications. 

Project Domain: This project will be focused around Cyber Security and education aimed specifically at novices in the field. 
The product intends to have a good balance of housing practical tools for the average homeowner whilst educating the user on why the tools have been incorporated and their use.

Description: Lock The Doors, Batten The Hatches intends to provide a safe user-friendly suit of tools aimed at educating cyber security novices on how to protect their
home and/or business on both the system side with tools like a secure password generator, and on the network side with tools like wireshark and netsh.
Other tools incorporated will include applications created by external companies and also tools created by the developers at Synergy Systems INC.
Lock The Doors, Batten The Hatches is a scalable application, meaning, the amount of tools and resources the application provides can be increased with time.
Currently the application houses 12 tools, 6 system tools, and 6 network tools as well as a plethora of useful links.

Features Include:
Easy to use interface to house multiple security tools. 
Educational descriptions and applications of each tool including images.
Lauch useful application, tools, and websites straight from the application.
Cross platform combadability with windows and mac systems.
Launches from a single JAR file.
